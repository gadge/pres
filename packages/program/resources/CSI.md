| CSI n ; m H | CUP  | Cursor Position              | Moves the cursor to row n, column m. The values are 1-based, and default to `1` (top left corner) if omitted. A sequence such as `CSI ;5H` is a synonym for `CSI 1;5H` as well as `CSI 17;H` is the same as `CSI 17H` and `CSI 17;1H`                                                                                                                                                                               |
| CSI n J     | ED   | Erase in Display             | Clears part of the screen. If n is `0` (or missing), clear from cursor to end of screen. If n is `1`, clear from cursor to beginning of the screen. If n is `2`, clear entire screen (and moves cursor to upper left on DOS [ANSI.SYS]). If n is `3`, clear entire screen and delete all lines saved in the scrollback buffer (this feature was added for [xterm] and is supported by other terminal applications). |
| CSI n K     | EL   | Erase in Line                | Erases part of the line. If n is `0` (or missing), clear from cursor to the end of the line. If n is `1`, clear from cursor to beginning of the line. If n is `2`, clear entire line. Cursor position does not change.                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| CSI n ; m f | HVP  | Horizontal Vertical Position | Same as CUP, but counts as a format effector function (like [CR] "Carriage return") or [LF] "Line feed") rather than an editor function (like CUD or CNL). This can lead to different handling in certain terminal modes.[[5]]:Annex A                                                                                                                                                                              |
